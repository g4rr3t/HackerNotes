Notes from Windows Security Course on https://fedvte.usalearning.gov/lyout.php

Windows NT is a family of operating systems produced by Microsoft, the first version of which was released on July 27, 1993. 
    It is a processor-independent, multiprocessing and multi-user operating system.
    Windows NT is a line of OS
    Windows NT 6.1 = Win 7, 6.2 = Win 8, 6.3 = Win 8.1, 10 = Win 10

Windows NT breaks 

Execution modes
    User Mode 
        Apps and many services run in user mode
            Can only access their own address space
            Are separated from OS kernal by win32 API
    Kernal Mode
        Full access
        OS runs in kernal mode
        Allows direct accses to memory, HW and apps
        Advanced CPU features and IO management
        Also known as protected mode or ring 0
        Ring protection  User mode outside kernal mode.
        Idea of OS constraining the user... not users constraining themselves because
            users were not good at constraining self



Authenticode - used to verify the source downloaded to ensure it's trusted
Environment Subsystem - allows applications that were written for different OS to run
    Win32 - standard MS Windows programs
    POSIX - Subsystem for unix-based apps
Integral Subsystem - contains subsystems provided with Windows
    Security
    Server service
    Worstation service

        Native apps V
App -> POSIX -> Win32 -> Kernal (Executive Service)

Kernal Mode
    Executive Service
        Provides common service available to all of the OS
        I/O Manager
        Security Reference Monitor
        Windows Manager
        Process Manager
        Object Manager
        Power Manager
        IPC Manager
        Others

    Hardware Abstraction Layer
        Provides an interface to HW
        Effectively allows the OS to run on multiple HW platforms by hiding or abstracting characteristics of the platform

Windows Security Model
    Windows is developed using a security development lifecycle

Code scanning tools
    Security tools designed to find SECURITY bugs in source code
    Static analysis tools - effective at finding errors that lead to vulnerabilities like buffer overflows
    Fuzz-testing tools - inject random data into application to see what happens
Code Review and Security testing
    Tools are not enough, human eyes are necessary
Security Testing
    Designed to test the security

Windows API application programming interface
    contains a collection of .dll files - dynamic link library
        library of code, promoting code reuse and provides efficient memory usage
    User32.dll - handles user interface functions
    Kernal32.dll - file operations, memory management
    Ggi32.dll - involved in graphical presentation

    DLL dependency - program or function that calls a function in another DLL, source of program failure when one fails to load
    Solving depenency issue
        Windows file protection
            prevents system DLLs from update or deletion from unauthorized agent by looking for valid signature
        Private DLLs
            located in programs root folder
            A .local file enforces use of specified DLL version

Windows Registry
    Collection of information about the system and users including
        HW
        Installed programs and settings
        User profiles and preferences
    A database, its a collection of discrete files called Hives
        each hive contains a registry tree.  At the base of the tree is a key that serves as the root key
    Registry structure
        5 root keys
            HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
            HKEY_CURRENT_USER
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
            HKEY_USERS
            HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
        Beneath the 5 root key are sub keys and values
        Values are the actual data stored in the keys and subkeys
            string, binary or DWORD(double word)
            others exist
        Registry Hives
            Tree structure
    Registry recommendations
        Backup the registry before making changes
        edit carefully
        limit the number of people who can access the registry
        Do not leave the registry editor running and unattended
        Do not run the registry editory as administrator, except when absolutely necessary

Authenticode
    A means of code signing that allows user to verify the source and integrity of the signed software
        A software publisher obtains a digital certificate from a CA
        The publisher of the software creates a digital signature by encrypting a hashed representatinon of the software with the others private key
        After downloading the software, the recipient verifies the signatre by decrypting it using the publisher's public key
        Certificate binds owner to key
        How does one know whos public key one has?
        X.509 standard defines digital certiificate specification

Threats and vulnerabilities
    Attacker motivation and rationale
        Black hat - malicious
        White hat - find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed
        Gray hay - Attack purpose is very debatable, actions are justifiable good by the attacker, but more harm than good could be caused
    Types of attackers
        cyber terrorists - attacks usually at a nation state level
        hacktivists - hackers with a specific cause - anonymous
        script kiddies - unskilled hackers
    Attackers' Goals
        Different goals and motivation of attackers
            Revenge
                From disgruntled customers to nation state enemies
            Money
                Sell credit card numbers etc
            Proof of skill
            Boredom
        
        Threats X Vulnerabilities X Asset Value = Total risk
    
“The best that program analysis tools can do in my experience
is to transform programmers into better programmers,
meaning you still have one error per 1000 lines of code.”

Microsoft common vulnerabilities and exploits (CVE)
    Print Spooler CVE - allows attackers to execute arbitrary code execution
    Kernal Mode Driver - crafted in TrueTypeFont file - victim opens malicious TTF file
    Microsoft XML - 
    Use after free - memory leakage attack - in IE
    CVE Metaslpoit framework - collection of attack tools
